# Licensing in EVE

EVE is a framework and language, not a product.

Licensing exists to:
- protect clarity and attribution
- enable reuse and extension
- prevent misrepresentation
- preserve interoperability

Not to restrict innovation.

## Framework vs Implementations

### The EVE Framework
Includes:
- SATE primitives
- design patterns
- governance principles
- documentation and schemas

The framework is:
- open
- forkable
- non-exclusive

Recommended license:
**Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 4.0)**

This allows:
- commercial and non-commercial use
- adaptation and extension
- redistribution

With the requirement of attribution.

---

### Implementations

Applications built *using* EVE:
- are owned by their creators
- may be proprietary or open-source
- choose their own licenses
- define their own governance

EVE does not claim ownership over implementations.

---

## Naming and attribution

Use of the name “EVE” should:
- clearly distinguish framework from implementation
- avoid implying endorsement or certification
- include attribution where appropriate

Forks should:
- rename clearly
- document differences
- avoid confusion with the original framework

---

## What licensing does *not* do

Licensing does not:
- enforce ethical behavior
- approve or reject use cases
- control incentive mechanisms
- regulate data usage

Those are addressed through:
- governance guidance
- ethics principles
- community norms

---

## Guiding principle

**EVE should be easier to reuse than to capture.**

If licensing becomes restrictive, it is no longer serving its purpose.
