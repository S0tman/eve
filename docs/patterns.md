# EVE Design Patterns

EVE Design Patterns describe **repeatable value flows** that can be reused across systems.

They are not UI patterns.
They are not business models.

They are **behavioral and economic patterns** that make value legible.

---

## How to use patterns

1. Choose a pattern that matches your context
2. Identify which SATE signals are involved
3. Decide whether incentives are needed
4. Select a verification method
5. Test, iterate, simplify

## Pattern: Value Inversion

**When participation creates value, reward it instead of charging for access.**

Problem:
Systems assume users must pay, even when their actions reduce costs or create shared benefit.

Pattern:
Invert the value flow so contributors are rewarded for participation.

SATE:
Attention · Time · Ecology

Typical incentives:
Level 2 → Level 3

Verification:
Two-sided confirmation, contextual validation

Common failure:
Over-rewarding → spam

Examples:
PARKIFY, energy shifting, waste sorting

---

## Pattern: Discovery Creates Value

**Finding something valuable is itself a valuable act.**

Problem:
Discovery work is invisible and unrewarded.

Pattern:
Treat discovery as a first-class contribution.

SATE:
Attention · Skill · Time

Typical incentives:
Level 1 → Level 2

Verification:
Peer confirmation, time-bound proofs

Examples:
PARKIFY spotters, Sonic Spots, local knowledge sharing

---

## Pattern: Pause as Infrastructure

**Sometimes the most valuable action is stopping.**

Problem:
Systems optimize for speed, output, and engagement.

Pattern:
Design intentional pauses where presence is the contribution.

SATE:
Attention · Time

Typical incentives:
Level 0 → Level 1

Verification:
Session completion, self-attestation

Examples:
prezns (Alice), reflection tools, coaching flows

---

## Pattern: Authorship Matters

**Value carries meaning when authorship is preserved.**

Problem:
Aggregation flattens individual contribution.

Pattern:
Preserve attribution, intent, and provenance.

SATE:
Skill · Attention · Time

Typical incentives:
Level 1 → Level 2

Verification:
Peer review, attribution chains

Examples:
STYL, remix tools, knowledge platforms

---

## Pattern: Participation Without Surveillance

**Participation should be voluntary, visible, and consent-based.**

Problem:
Participation is measured through passive tracking.

Pattern:
Use explicit signals instead of surveillance.

SATE:
Attention · Time

Typical incentives:
Level 0 → Level 1

Verification:
Opt-in reporting, voluntary check-ins

Examples:
Civic systems, public services, trust-sensitive domains
