# Governance in EVE

EVE is designed to be **stewarded**, not controlled.

Governance exists to:
- protect the integrity of the framework
- prevent misuse
- enable long-term trust
- preserve interoperability

Not to:
- centralize power
- enforce ideology
- dictate implementations

---

## Governance philosophy

EVE follows a **lightweight stewardship model**.

This means:
- principles over rules
- patterns over mandates
- guardrails over enforcement

Governance should reduce risk — not slow adoption.

---

## What governance covers

EVE governance focuses on four areas:

### 1. Framework integrity
- maintaining clarity of SATE definitions
- preserving design pattern intent
- preventing dilution or misrepresentation

### 2. Ethical constraints
- consent-first participation
- opt-in data usage
- proportional incentives
- non-extractive design

### 3. Interoperability
- avoiding lock-in
- encouraging adapters, not dependencies
- supporting multiple implementations

### 4. Stewardship continuity
- ensuring EVE remains usable beyond any single organization
- supporting forks when values diverge

---

## What governance does *not* cover

EVE governance does **not**:
- approve or reject applications
- control local incentive structures
- manage user data
- issue tokens or currencies
- arbitrate disputes between implementations

Those responsibilities remain local.

---

## Proposed governance structure (v1)

This is a reference model — not a requirement.

- A non-profit foundation or steward entity
- A small, rotating advisory group
- Clear public documentation
- Open issue tracking for framework evolution

No mandatory membership.
No central authority over implementations.

---

## Forking and divergence

Forking is permitted and expected.

If values diverge:
- fork the framework
- rename clearly
- document differences

This is a feature, not a failure.

---

## Governance principle

**EVE should be harder to capture than to adopt.**

If governance becomes heavy, it is no longer serving its purpose.
