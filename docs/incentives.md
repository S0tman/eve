# Incentives in EVE

Incentives are not the purpose of EVE.  
They are the bridge between recognized value and sustained participation.

EVE treats incentives as a **programmable value-routing layer** that helps systems respond to real human contribution — without coercion, surveillance, or ideology.

## Why incentives matter

People already create value.

But in many systems:
- participation is invisible
- effort is taken for granted
- benefits accrue elsewhere

Incentives help systems:
- notice contribution
- respond proportionally
- sustain participation over time

## The Incentives Ladder

Only climb the ladder when the previous level fails to create participation.

### Level 0 — Recognition
Value is acknowledged, not rewarded.

Examples:
- public acknowledgment
- contribution badges
- access to insights or feedback

Use when:
- intrinsic motivation is high
- participation already exists
- over-incentivizing would distort intent

---

### Level 1 — Social Rewards
Lightweight rewards that signal appreciation.

Examples:
- status indicators
- priority access
- community roles

Use when:
- recognition alone is insufficient
- social signaling reinforces behavior

---

### Level 2 — Utility Rewards
Rewards that reduce friction or cost.

Examples:
- discounts
- credits
- service priority

Use when:
- participation saves time, money, or resources for others
- benefits are concrete but modest

---

### Level 3 — Convertible Rewards
Rewards that can be exchanged for external value.

Examples:
- points convertible to fiat
- vouchers
- cash-equivalent credits

Use when:
- participation creates measurable downstream value
- reliability is critical
- verification is strong

---

## A simple rule

**Incentives should correlate with downstream value created — not with effort alone.**

---

## Example: PARKIFY

A spotter spends 2 seconds reporting a parking spot.  
Another driver saves several minutes of circling.  
Traffic is reduced.  
Emissions drop.  
Urban allocation improves.

Without an incentive, participation is rare.  
With a small, proportional reward, participation becomes reliable.

This is an example of the **Value Inversion** pattern.

## Incentive Design Checklist

Before adding incentives, ask:

- What value is being created?
- Who benefits downstream?
- What is the smallest reward that changes behavior?
- How is participation verified?
- How do we prevent gaming?
- Can incentives be removed later without breaking trust?

If you cannot answer these, do not add incentives yet.

---

## Verification Patterns

Verification should be proportional, lightweight, and respectful.

Common patterns:
- two-sided confirmation (contributor + beneficiary)
- random audits
- rate limits
- time-bound proofs
- contextual validation (location, time window)

Avoid:
- permanent scoring of people
- opaque algorithms
- invasive tracking

---

## Closing

Incentives do not create value.  
They reveal it.

Well-designed incentives make participation sustainable without distorting intent.
