# Common Mistakes When Implementing EVE

EVE is intentionally simple — but that simplicity can be misunderstood.

This document highlights common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

---

## Mistake 1: Starting with tokens

Problem:
Teams jump directly to points, credits, or currencies.

Why it fails:
- incentives without value clarity distort behavior
- gaming appears before trust is established

What to do instead:
- start by identifying SATE signals
- make value visible first
- add incentives only if participation stalls

---

## Mistake 2: Measuring everything

Problem:
Attempting to quantify all human activity.

Why it fails:
- creates surveillance dynamics
- erodes trust
- increases complexity

What to do instead:
- measure only what is necessary
- prefer opt-in signals
- accept partial visibility

---

## Mistake 3: Over-rewarding participation

Problem:
Incentives become the goal instead of the activity.

Why it fails:
- spam
- low-quality contributions
- loss of intrinsic motivation

What to do instead:
- use the Incentives Ladder
- keep rewards proportional
- design for removal over time

---

## Mistake 4: Treating EVE as a scoring system

Problem:
Reducing EVE to a single score or rank.

Why it fails:
- flattens human contribution
- encourages comparison over meaning
- reintroduces extractive logic

What to do instead:
- treat SATE as a lens, not a grade
- preserve context and narrative
- avoid permanent rankings

---

## Mistake 5: Ignoring verification

Problem:
Assuming goodwill will prevent misuse.

Why it fails:
- incentives attract edge cases
- trust degrades quickly

What to do instead:
- design verification early
- keep it lightweight
- match verification strength to reward level

---

## Mistake 6: Over-centralizing governance

Problem:
Trying to control all use cases from the center.

Why it fails:
- slows adoption
- creates bottlenecks
- undermines interoperability

What to do instead:
- publish patterns, not rules
- allow local adaptation
- focus on ethical guardrails

---

## Mistake 7: Framing EVE as ideology

Problem:
Positioning EVE as “the new system.”

Why it fails:
- increases resistance
- raises political and institutional risk
- limits adoption

What to do instead:
- frame EVE as infrastructure
- emphasize complementarity
- let use cases speak first

---

## Final reminder

EVE works best when it:
- makes value visible
- respects human agency
- stays close to lived reality

If implementation feels heavy, complex, or coercive — pause.
