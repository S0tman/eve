# Interoperability in EVE

EVE is designed to sit **beneath** systems, not replace them.

It is a value layer — not a platform, protocol, or ideology.

---

## Why interoperability matters

Most large-scale initiatives fail because they ask people to:
- abandon existing systems
- adopt new belief structures
- migrate data, identity, and workflows

EVE takes a different approach.

It assumes:
- existing systems will continue to exist
- AI, automation, and productivity tools will proliferate
- value creation will increasingly happen *outside* traditional transactions

Interoperability is how EVE remains useful in that world.

## EVE’s position in the stack

EVE operates as a **semantic and incentive layer**:

- Above infrastructure (cloud, AI models, automation)
- Below applications (products, services, civic tools)
- Orthogonal to institutions (public, private, nonprofit)

EVE does not compete with:
- accounting systems
- payment rails
- identity providers
- governance frameworks

Instead, it **augments them** by making non-monetary value legible.

## What EVE interoperates with

### AI and productivity systems
- LLM-based applications
- automation platforms
- robotics and embodied AI
- no-code / vibe-coding tools

EVE helps answer:
> “What value did this automation unlock — and for whom?”

---

### Civic and sustainability frameworks
- behavior change programs
- citizen participation initiatives
- ecological impact tracking
- public service innovation

EVE provides:
- opt-in value signals
- incentive routing
- participation visibility

---

### Enterprise systems
- CRM, ERP, HR platforms
- learning and knowledge systems
- innovation and transformation programs

EVE complements:
- KPIs with human signals
- outcomes with participation context

---

## Interoperability mechanisms

EVE interoperates through **adapters**, not mandates.

Typical adapters include:
- event logs → SATE signals
- participation records → incentives
- attestations → verification proofs
- metrics → value narratives

EVE does not require:
- centralized data
- global identity
- token issuance
- blockchain adoption

Those are optional, not assumed.

---

## Neutral by design, aligned by use

EVE is:
- neutral at the framework level
- opinionated at the pattern level
- constrained by ethics and consent

This allows EVE to:
- integrate with diverse initiatives
- avoid ideological capture
- remain adaptable over time

---

## Key principle

**EVE should be easier to add than to replace.**

If interoperability requires re-platforming, EVE is being misused.
