# Example: PARKIFY (Value Inversion)

PARKIFY is a practical implementation of the **Value Inversion** pattern.

---

## Context

Urban drivers spend significant time circling for parking.
This increases:
- congestion
- emissions
- stress
- inefficiency

Yet people frequently see available spots and do nothing with that information.

---

## The Value Created

A spotter:
- spends ~2 seconds reporting a spot

A parker:
- saves several minutes of circling

The city:
- reduces congestion and emissions
- improves allocation of scarce infrastructure

---

## The Pattern Applied

Pattern:
**Value Inversion**

Instead of charging users to find parking:
- contributors are rewarded for sharing availability

---

## SATE Signals

- Attention: noticing the available spot
- Time: minimal effort to report
- Ecology: reduced emissions and traffic

---

## Incentives Used

Incentive level:
**Level 3 — Convertible Rewards**

- Spotters earn points
- Points can be converted to fiat
- Reward is proportional to verified benefit

---

## Verification

- Two-sided confirmation:
  - spotter reports
  - parker confirms
- Contextual validation:
  - time window
  - location proximity
- Rate limits prevent spam

---

## Outcome

Without incentives:
- participation is rare

With small, proportional incentives:
- participation becomes reliable
- value is shared
- trust increases

---

## Key Takeaway

PARKIFY works because incentives reflect **shared downstream value**, not effort alone.

This is the core of Value Inversion.
